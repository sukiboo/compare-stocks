# Stock Prices Comparison Tool

**This project is WIP and I don't know when I'm going to finish it :(**

Trying to implement something similar to https://www.barchart.com/myBarchart/quotes/SPY/interactive-chart but in Plotly.
An interactive tool that retrieves historical stock prices using `yfinance` and shows normalized prices over selected time intervals.
